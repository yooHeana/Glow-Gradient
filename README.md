## Inspiration
Small humidifier is beside my macbook.
Its mood-light color changes.
I chose yellow to skyblue color for this practice.

COLORS = [
    {r: 245, g: 223, b: 77},
    {r: 156, g: 156, b: 156},
    {r: 52, g: 149, b: 235},
    {r: 94, g: 245, b: 77},
    {r: 200, g: 245, b: 77},
];

## Details
* Each Color elements has its own color.
* They are circle-shaped, and blurred.
* Using [globalCompositeOperation - "overlay"] makes the gradient seem like white-vapor  :)

## Built With
* JavaScript Canvas
